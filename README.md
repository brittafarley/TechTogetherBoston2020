# TechTogetherBoston2020

With so much social media bullying going on, I decided to create 
a program to combat mean speech with positive affirmations.
I'm new to programming, so I wrote this program using the
only language I know. 
This Python program includes the use of event-controlled loops, Boolean operators, 
input and print statements. I plan on working on this program in the future
and publishing it to the web once I learn other programming languages. 
I hope that you enjoy the little program I created as much as I do.
